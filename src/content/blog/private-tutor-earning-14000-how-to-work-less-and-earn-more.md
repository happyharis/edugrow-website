I saw in reddit this tutor earned $14,000 per month. That is really impressive. So how does this tutor do it?

**A Look at the Hours**

This tutor works 5 hours each weekday (from 4 pm to 9 pm), 11 hours on Saturdays (from 9 am to 8 pm, with a 1-hour break), and 9 hours on Sundays (from 9 am to 6 pm, with a 1-hour break). If we add it all up, that’s 25 hours from Monday to Friday, plus 18 hours over the weekend. So, in total, they’re working 45 hours a week.

Now, let’s do some quick math. If they’re earning about $13,000 to $14,000 per month, and they’re putting in 180 hours each month (45 hours per week times 4 weeks), their hourly rate can be calculated as follows:

**Monthly Income and Hourly Rate Table**

| Monthly Income (\$) | Total Hours Worked | Hourly Rate (\$/hour) |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 13,000             | 180                | 72.22                 |
| 14,000             | 180                | 77.78                 |

That’s pretty good money, especially considering they teach subjects like Literature, History, Geography, Social Studies, and English—subjects that often have fewer tutors available, which makes their skills even more valuable.

**But At What Cost?**

Working 7 days a week isn’t easy. It takes a toll on your body and mind, and it leaves almost no time for relaxation or hobbies. This tutor is able to manage it because they don’t have kids and they’re fully focused on their career. But what if they wanted to slow down a little? What if they wanted weekends off or even just a break now and then?

**The Solution: Hiring a Tutor**

Here’s an interesting idea: what if they hired another tutor to help out? Imagine this tutor could hire someone to take on some of their weekend work. Even if they paid this tutor a generous salary, it would still allow them to increase their hourly earnings. How? Let’s break it down.

Say they hired another tutor for $40 per hour. If that tutor took on half of the hours, our original tutor could still keep a large portion of their monthly income while working fewer hours. Let’s say they work only 20 hours per week instead of 45. They’d still be earning a substantial income, but their per-hour rate would effectively increase because they’d be making money off the work done by their hired tutor.

**Working Smarter, Not Harder**

By hiring help, this tutor could improve their quality of life while still earning a good income. Instead of working every single day, they’d have time to rest, recharge, and maybe even grow their tutoring business further. They could focus on finding more students, building better relationships with parents, or even expanding into new subjects. Plus, their effective hourly rate would be higher because they’re making money through the work of others—something that’s often key to growing a business.

**Final Thoughts**

This tutor’s dedication is impressive. Not everyone can work 7 days a week, year-round, and still maintain a high quality of teaching. But there comes a point where working every single day isn’t sustainable. By hiring another tutor, they could earn more per hour, work less, and still provide great education to their students. It’s about working smarter, not harder—a lesson that’s just as important as the ones they teach.
