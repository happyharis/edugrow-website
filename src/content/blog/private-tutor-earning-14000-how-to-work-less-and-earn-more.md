I saw in [reddit this tutor](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/17336lb/comment/lady8jc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) earned $14,000 per month. That is really impressive. So how does this tutor do it?

**A Look at the Hours**

This tutor works 5 hours each weekday (from 4 pm to 9 pm), 11 hours on Saturdays (from 9 am to 8 pm, with a 1-hour break), and 9 hours on Sundays (from 9 am to 6 pm, with a 1-hour break). If we add it all up, that’s 25 hours from Monday to Friday, plus 18 hours over the weekend. So, in total, they’re working 45 hours a week.

Now, let’s do some quick math. If they’re earning about $13,000 to $14,000 per month, and they’re putting in 180 hours each month (45 hours per week times 4 weeks), their hourly rate can be calculated as follows:

**Monthly Income and Hourly Rate Table**

| Monthly Income (\$) | Total Hours Worked | Hourly Rate (\$/hour) |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| 13,000             | 180                | 72.22                 |
| 14,000             | 180                | 77.78                 |

That’s pretty good money, especially considering they teach subjects like Literature, History, Geography, Social Studies, and English—subjects that often have fewer tutors available, which makes their skills even more valuable.

**But At What Cost?**

Working 7 days a week isn’t easy. It takes a toll on your body and mind, and it leaves almost no time for relaxation or hobbies. This tutor is able to manage it because they don’t have kids and they’re fully focused on their career. But what if they wanted to slow down a little? What if they wanted weekends off or even just a break now and then?

**The Solution: Hiring a Full-Time Tutor**

Another approach would be to hire a full-time tutor to replace themselves completely. Let’s say they hire someone for $4,000 to $5,000 per month. This hired tutor could handle all the current workload, and the original tutor would only need to focus on managing this person, which might take around 3 to 4 hours per week.

This strategy not only helps reclaim a significant amount of time but also allows the original tutor to focus on other opportunities, like expanding their tutoring services or pursuing new ventures.

**Monthly Income and Hourly Rate Table (Before and After Hiring a Full-Time Tutor)**

| Scenario                     | Monthly Income (\$) | Total Hours Worked | Hourly Rate (\$/hour) |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Before Hiring               | 14,000              | 180                | 77.78                 |
| After Hiring Full-Time Tutor| 9,500               | 16                 | 593.75                |

By hiring a full-time tutor and working only 3 to 4 hours per week to manage them, the original tutor's effective hourly rate increases significantly. They would now earn $9,500 per month while only working 16 hours, bringing their hourly rate up to $593.75.

This approach allows them to work smarter—earning a substantial income while spending less time actively tutoring, which frees them up for other pursuits.


**Working Smarter, Not Harder**

By hiring help, this tutor could improve their quality of life while still earning a good income. Instead of working every single day, they’d have time to rest, recharge, and maybe even grow their tutoring business further. They could focus on finding more students, building better relationships with parents, or even expanding into new subjects. Plus, their effective hourly rate would be higher because they’re making money through the work of others—something that’s often key to growing a business.

**Actionable Steps for Hiring a Full-Time Tutor**

Record a Training for the Tutor: Create a detailed training video covering all the important aspects of tutoring, including teaching methods, subject matter, and student management.

Create a Job Post: Write a clear and detailed job description that outlines the requirements, responsibilities, and benefits of the tutor position.

Interview Tutors: Conduct interviews to find a suitable candidate who meets the qualifications and fits well with your tutoring style and values.

Onboard: Once hired, onboard the tutor by providing all necessary resources, access to teaching materials, and guidelines for student interaction.

Manage: Spend 3 to 4 hours per week managing the tutor, offering feedback, support, and ensuring that the quality of education is maintained.

**Final Thoughts**

This tutor’s dedication is impressive. Not everyone can work 7 days a week, year-round, and still maintain a high quality of teaching. But there comes a point where working every single day isn’t sustainable. By hiring another tutor, they could earn more per hour, work less, and still provide great education to their students. It’s about working smarter, not harder—a lesson that’s just as important as the ones they teach.
