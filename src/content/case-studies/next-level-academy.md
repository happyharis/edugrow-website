_Context: It was a coding course for JC students after A levels. Take note, what is shared is just rough figures, and not exact numbers._

We only did 1 thing: increase the price.

| **Metric**           | **Before**                    | **After**                    |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Number of Students   | 60 students                   | 15 students                  |
| Rate per Student     | $150 per student              | $600 per student             |
| Total Revenue        | $9000                         | $9000                        |
| Expense per Student  | $60 per student               | $60 per student              |
| Total Expenses       | $3600                         | $900                          |
| Profits              | $5400                         | $8100                        |

With increased price, I reduce cost by 400% and increase profits by 1.5x. 

Best part: nothing changed. Only price increase.

Yes, there were 4x less students. However, profits increased.

Revenue is vanity.
Profit is sanity.
