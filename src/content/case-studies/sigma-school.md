_Context: Sigma School is where we help people learn coding to get a job_

3 things that we did that helped reach 7 figures.

1. Price increase
2. I stopped teaching
3. Testimonials & Reviews, a lot of them

## Price increase

When I joined Sigma School, they were priced at a low price for the course. Therefore, I mentioned to Deric, the founder of Sigma School to increase the price. After disussing and going back and forth, we decided to increase the price of the course.

What happened next? Fewer students joined (not to a point that it was mission critical). What's crazier? Profits increased.

I have a price increase calculator here to show you how much profits you can benefit, without changing almost anything. 

## I stopped teaching

After teaching for 7 years, I knew that I don't want to teach anymore, but I want Sigma School to have the best learning materials. Therefore, I decided to stop teaching. However, this is with the plan of imparting what I knew into the learning materials i.e. slides and coding exercises.

Therefore, I spend a lot of time, I mean a lot of time to create the learning materials the best I could. I initially started to teach one batch of students. And on average, I have 9/10 ratings. This is because for:

Every jargon and fancy words - explained like I'm teaching kids

Every concepts that are hard to understand - create drawings and visualisation so they have a better understanding

Once I invested a lot of my time into the learning materials, the students can just read through it, the instructors that I hired will then go through

Then the next step is to actually hire a tutor or instructor to replace me

Because, more than half the day, I was preparing the learning materials and teaching

And the other half is helping to operate and grow the business

Therefore, it makes sense to hire someone, so I can focus on building the business to something that always gives consistent learning experience and results.

And it did. Once I got my time back, I was able to:

- Create automations that sends onboarding email and WhatsApp messages after a student has paid successfully
- Create invoices to send to students 
- Manage and grow my team
- Create ways that we can grow as a business
- Create more success stories from students
- Create feedback system

## Testimonials & Reviews, a lot of them

This helps us to actually make students join us or want to know more about Sigma School. We collected testimonials as much as we could so that people build trust in us

One thing that a student of mine told me that he went to one of our graduates and had a talk with him

And he was convinced by the graduate that the coding bootcamp was for him

That is where the power of testimonials and reviews actually really help

## Bonus: Follow ups

We then hired a sales executive to start following up with the students. And this has led to an increase of sales. Dayum. Just follwing up or calling the leads that we have actually made good progress on getting our revenue

Therefore, this was 3 ways that I helped grow the business. Simple, yet hard to execute. All the best!
