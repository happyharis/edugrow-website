    question: "How does the membership work?",
    answer:
      "With your membership, you get access to our exclusive community group, weekly coaching calls, implementation guides, automation systems, and endless support from peers and mentors. You'll also get access to our resource library containing templates, scripts, and guides to help scale your education business.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm unhappy with the results?",
    answer:
      "We don't think this will happen, but if it does, you can cancel your membership at any time. There's no obligation to continue if the group isn't what you expected it to be. We want to ensure you're getting value from your investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "When do the calls happen?",
    answer:
      "Pro Group calls happen weekly on Zoom, typically every Wednesday at 10am Singapore Time. All calls are recorded and made available in our resource library, so you won't miss anything even if you can't attend live. We also host implementation sessions and special workshops throughout the month.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know that the membership is right for me?",
    answer:
      "If you're an education business owner or tutor who is serious about scaling your impact and income, this is the place for you. Our members include tutors, enrichment center owners, online course creators, and education consultants from all over Singapore and Asia. If you have any questions about the Pro membership, email us at support@edugrow.org.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is your refund policy?",
    answer: `By policy, we don't accept refund requests on the sale of digital goods unless it's stated clearly on a published sales page. Here's why: Digital products are much different than physical goods. By returning a physical good to a seller, the merchant gets to keep the original value of that product. With digital goods, a return is a total and complete loss to the merchant, especially once the content has been "consumed."

We understand that members may sometimes miss the opportunity to cancel their membership before the renewal date due to unforeseen circumstances. To address this, we offer a 48-hour grace period for members to request a refund if they wish to cancel their membership. Please send our support team a message at support@edugrow.org.

Our program is centered around growing education businesses and implementing systems, both of which are undoubtedly difficult and complex to accomplish. It's our mission to make the complex simple. But the hard work still must be done. Once you learn how, the execution is in your hands.

Rest assured: we obsess over the quality of our learning material and we test everything with beta users first to make sure that the content works. The testimonials speak for themselves!

So instead of requesting a refund, we invite you to ask questions. Participate actively in the weekly calls and implementation sessions. Engage with the community. Get the information you need to attain the goals you want. This will help us make the program better and improve the resources we provide.`,

              I started my education business journey as a freelance coding &

              Like many of you, I was passionate about teaching but struggled
              with the business side of things: hiring, marketing, and
              operations.

            The Hard Truth: Ads don't grow your business, systems do
          </h2>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Let me be honest with you: The methods that helped you earn your
            first $100,000 won't help you earn $1 million.

            <br /><br />

            Many people think spending more money on advertisements or trying
            every new marketing trick is the answer. They're wrong. Working
            until you're completely tired won't help either.

            <br /><br />

            As the famous author James Clear says: "You don't achieve your goals
            just by setting them. You achieve what your daily habits allow."

            <br /><br />

            Here's what most people don't tell you about growing an education
            business:

            <br /><br />

            When you're just starting out, you need good systems to turn random
            student recommendations into regular enrollments. You need proper
            marketing and sales methods that bring in new students regularly -
            without you having to work extra hard all the time.

            <br /><br />

            When your business starts growing, you need systems that help you
            work smarter. This means creating standard ways to handle new
            students and teach lessons. Because you can't grow bigger if
            everything depends on you alone.

            <br /><br />

            And when you're ready to expand? You need strong systems that keep
            your teaching quality high even when you're not teaching. This means
            having clear training guides, ways to measure quality, and methods
            to track how well things are going.

            <br /><br />

            The EduGrow PRO group isn't about quick solutions that only work for
            a while. We help you build strong systems that turn your education
            business from a tiring job into something that can grow bigger
            without you working harder.

            <br /><br />

            We've made mistakes before. We've learned important lessons. Now,
            we're here to help you build these important systems without wasting
            years figuring things out on your own.

            <br /><br />

            Because here's the truth: Working IN your business keeps you busy.
            But working ON your business - through systematic, measurable
            improvements - makes you successful.

            <br /><br />

            Are you ready to stop letting your business control your life and
            start controlling it instead?
