          Word from Haris, Founder of EduGrow
        </p>

        <p>
          Hey there! As an educator who's built a 7-figure education business, I've seen firsthand the 
          challenges that tutors face. Through countless conversations with fellow educators, I've noticed 
          a common thread: brilliant teachers struggling to turn their expertise into profitable businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's the thing - I love making money, and I'm good at it. But more importantly, I love 
          helping other educators succeed. I've cracked the code on building a profitable education 
          business, and now I'm here to share everything I know.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-8">Why I Do This</h3>
        <p>
          Too many talented educators are:
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
            <li>Working too many hours for too little return</li>
            <li>Struggling to attract and retain students</li>
            <li>Missing out on the income they deserve</li>
            <li>Feeling overwhelmed by the business side of tutoring</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that great educators deserve great rewards. My mission is to help you build a 
          thriving tutoring business that gives you both the income and the impact you're looking for. 
          No more choosing between making money and making a difference - you can do both.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let me show you how to transform your teaching expertise into a profitable business that 
          serves your students while serving you. Because when educators prosper, everyone wins.
        </p>
